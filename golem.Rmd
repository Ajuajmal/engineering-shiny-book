# Using Golem {#golem}

Ok, that’s a lot of things to process. Is there a tool that can help us simplify this workflow? Of course there is, and it’s called `{golem}`.

It can be found at https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem

`{golem}` is an R package that implements an opinionated framework for building production-ready Shiny apps. It all starts with an RStudio project, which contains a predefined setup for building your app. The idea is that with `{golem}`, you don’t have to focus on the foundation of your app, and can spend your time thinking about what you want to do, not about how to do it. It’s built on top of the working process we’ve developed at ThinkR, and tries to gather in one place the functions and tools we’ve created for building applications designed for production.

When you open a golem project, you’ll start with a dev-history file, which contains a series of functions that will guide you through the whole process of starting, building, and deploying your app. The newly created package also contains an app_ui.R and app_server.R waiting to be filled, and a run_app() function that will launch your application. Any new module can be added with golem::add_module(), a function that creates a new file with the required skeleton for a shiny module. As I said, you don’t need to think about the technical things.
You can also find a series of UI, server, and prod-related tools, functions for creating deployment scripts, and other cool stuffs. Check the README for more information.
